## Hepar Core (Advisory Tier)

Modular implementation of Hepar forensic stack, including:
- Stage A: Static Forensics
- Stage B: Symbolic Proving
- Stage C: Multi-Agent Monte Carlo
- Stage D: Consensus Fusion & Attestation

This package is the canonical source for Hepar agent logic, consensus, and attestation. All consumers should import from here.

---

**Integration:**
- Exposes `runHepar`, `runStageA`, `runStageB`, `runStageC`, `runStageD` entry points.
- Types and agent logic are colocated for maintainability.

**Status:**
- Advisory tier (fixture-verified, not live-telemetry-verified)
- Wallet taint and symbolic engines require pipeline integration for production
