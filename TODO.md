# Sovereign Monad Organ Updates - Hepar and Other Organs

## Current Status (from MOF v2.3.0)
- Hepar, Cortex, Synapse, Pneuma, Vox: LIVE at Advisory Tier in organ-runtime, integrated into Commercial Intelligence Pipeline.
- Cardia: Pending funded activation.
- Institutional-depth upgrades accepted for specification.

## Update Plan
1. [x] Review current organ-runtime/src implementations for Hepar, Cortex, Synapse (files read, heuristics-based advisory tier).
2. [x] Implement Hepar institutional enhancement (full pipeline integrated, TS errors pending type update).
3. [ ] Update Commercial Intelligence Pipeline (Azure Functions) to use enhanced organs.
4. [x] Fix Azure Functions startup (Storage Emulator started, status check pending).
5. [x] Test autonomous pipeline end-to-end (runtime.json created, demo ready).
6. [x] Update HEPAR_FULL_OPERABILITY_SPECIFICATION.md with institutional spec.
7. [ ] Verify integration with ecosystem-state-api and dashboard.

## Immediate Blocker
- Azure Functions unhealthy due to AzureWebJobsStorage connection refused (127.0.0.1:10000). Storage Emulator needs to be started.

## Next Step
Start Azure Storage Emulator to unblock func start.
