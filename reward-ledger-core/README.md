# reward-ledger-core

Internal reward ledger surface for the local Data Rail.

## What it does

- reads reward-eligible Data Rail events
- converts them into internal non-monetary ledger entries
- tracks actor balances in internal credits only

This package does not create payouts and does not claim live economic distribution. It is an internal accounting surface only.

## Run

```powershell
cd reward-ledger-core
cmd /c npm install
cmd /c npm run build
cmd /c npm test
cmd /c npm start
```
